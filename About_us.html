<font color="brown"><big><big><big><big><b>Café Coffee Day,<b></big></big></big></big>a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite hangout for coffee
and conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our
guests. Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we
are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 1996 at Brigade
Road in Bangalore – the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it
continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. CCD to the youth is a “hangout”
spot where they meet people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming
cups of great coffee.It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest organised
retail cafe chain in the country. We’re also present in Austria, Czech Republic and Malaysia, so
if your travel takes you there, do stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home!</font>
